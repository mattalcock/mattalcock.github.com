I love the marriage of design, fashion and technology in this project. This is another one of the projects I’m funding through kickstarter. Mary Huang a graduate of UCLA Design and Media Arts has been working with Jenna Fizel to create a web based drawing application that lets you model you own little black dress. Although I’m not a frequent wearer of ladies clothing I still find the project extremely interesting. The style of the dress is driven by the Processing algorithm however the shape, layout and dimensions are completely customisable. Here is what Mary had to say about the project……

Continuum is a user-generated fashion collection. I call it computational couture. It is the application of interactive technologies for bespoke design. 

In short, an app lets you draw a dress, turns it into a 3D model, and exports a cutting pattern to make the real dress, sized to your measurements. A laser cutter or plotter cuts the pattern out of fabric, which is then sewn into the dress. All the designs are unified around the theme of the little black dress, and the triangulation used in the software. This allows basically everyone to create their own innovative dress design.

Some screen grabs of the application. Try it out here ->
