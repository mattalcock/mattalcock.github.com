I love creative projects that use technology and I enjoy funding inspiring people through kickstarter. So when I found out about the ‘Written Images’ project I had to get involved and back their fund raising. Their project is to create and print a batch of totally individual art books.

The team use input from artists that span the globe to generate these unique books. Artists submit Processing (an artistic coding language) code to a central system that in tern source different publicly available data to derive or seed the individual art forms. These art forms are collected and a high quality printed book is generated. Some of there artwork and a brief video of how the process works are below...
